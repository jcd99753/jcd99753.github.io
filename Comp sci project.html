            <p>The Georgia football team has historically been one of the best in the country. The team is known for its storied history, unique traditions, and rabid fan base. Over the years, the Bulldogs have won 14 conference championships, 2 national titles, and an additional 3 national titles that are unclaimed. The Bulldogs have also appeared in 52 bowl games throughout the program's 125 year tenure, the 4th most of all time . Given these accolades, it's not hard to imagine the amount of talent that has come out of this school. Georgia has produced 2 Heisman winners and <em>31 All-Americans!</em> With the addition of Head Coach Kirby Smart; a former UGA football player himself, the Dawgs look to continue that winning tradition for years to come.
         Here is what some of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play between the hedges were able to accomplish over the course of their college careers.</p>

         <p>Whether you have been a life long Gerogia fan, or you're just hopping on the bandwagon, everyone in the nation has realized that it's a good time to be a Dawg. Although they fell short to rival Auburn in last weeks matchup, this was the first time since 2008 that the bulldogs have been ranked number one during the regular season. Many people thought that the season would be over after sophomore quarterback went out with an injury during the 1st quarter of game 1. Thanks to a historic season from the defense, a big step up by freshman quarterback Jake Fromm, and one of the best backfields in the country, the bulldogs have become serious playoff contendors.</p>
         <p>One of the things that has led to the bulldog's success over the years is the strength of their running game. This season alone, Georgia has already amassed for over 2500 rushing yards, and the season isn't even over! Senior running backs Nick Chubb and Sony Michel have recieved the majority of the workload this season, but the future looks bright for the Bulldog backfield. In addition to freshman standout D'andre Swift, UGA has managed to recruit 2 of the top running backs in the nation for the in the class of 2018. Below is a list of the all time leading rushers at Georgia, one of which still has a little bit of time to put some more numbers up on the board.</p>
